# The CPANTesters Project

A meta-project for tracking CPAN Testers project goals. [See the Issues
for project tracking or to see how you can get
involved](https://github.com/cpan-testers/cpantesters-project/issues)

[See the project roadmap for future plans and to give input on the
project planning](https://github.com/cpan-testers/cpantesters-project/tree/master/ROADMAP.md)

## Project Overview

The CPAN Testers project is an effort to ensure the quality and
stability of the packages uploaded to [CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network](http://www.cpan.org), the official repository for
sharing Perl libraries and applications.

Contributers submit test reports by downloading content from CPAN and
running the included test suite. These test reports are sent to
a repository called Metabase. Reports are then read from Metabase, and
parsed for important statistics which are saved to the CPAN Testers
database. This database has a web application where authors can see the
test reports for their distributions.

## Repositories

These are the repositories that are meta-managed by this repository.

### Metabase

Metabase is the primary source for CPAN Testers reports. Reporters write
directly to the Metabase to send in reports. This replaces the original
reports which were sent via e-mail, and used a Usenet group as the
canonical repository.

* [Metabase](https://github.com/rjbs/metabase)
    * The main Metabase repository.
* [Metabase::Fact](https://github.com/dagolden/Metabase-Fact)
    * The core model that is stored in the Metabase. The Metabase
      consists of a collection of Metabase Facts.
* [Metabase::Web](https://github.com/dagolden/metabase-web)
    * The Metabase web application <http://metabase.cpantesters.org>.

### CPANTesters

These are the modules that comprise the CPANTesters application,
including the backend ETL which loads and parses reports from Metabase
and the web application that displays reports and statistics.

#### Backend

Backend modules handle processing and parsing reports.

* [cpantesters-schema](https://github.com/cpan-testers/cpantesters-schema)
    * This is a [DBIx::Class](http://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class)
      schema for the CPAN Testers database.
* [Data::Generator](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-data-generator)
    * This module handles grabbing reports from the Metabase and inserting
      them into the correct places in the CPANTesters report database
* [Data::Uploads](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-data-uploads)
    * The Uploads database contains basic information about the history
      of CPAN, including the release dates of all CPAN and BackPAN
      modules, direct from PAUSE. This is generated directly from the
      local CPAN Testers CPAN and BackPAN mirrors.
* [Data::Uploads::Mailer](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-data-uploads-mailer)
    * Send e-mails when invalid distributions are uploaded to CPAN
* [Data::Release](https://github.com/barbie/CPAN-Testers-Data-Release)
    * Create a standalone database from the release summary information.

[See detailed documentation about these processes and how they are
used](https://github.com/cpan-testers/cpantesters-project/tree/master/BACKEND.md)

#### Frontend

Frontend modules handle the web application.

* [cpantesters-api](https://github.com/cpan-testers/cpantesters-api)
    * This is a JSON API on to CPAN Testers data.
* [WWW::Reports](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-www-reports)
  * This handles the [main reports website
    (cpantesters.org)](http://cpantesters.org), which allows for viewing
    individual reports, and listing reports by distribution and author.
    This is the primary application of CPANTesters.
* [WWW::Admin](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-www-admin)
  * This handles the [administration website
    (admin.cpantesters.org)](http://admin.cpantesters.org), which allows
    CPAN authors and testers to flag reports which may have been sent in
    error. For example, authors can flag reports that were generated by
    a misconfigured CPAN client and are a problem with the client and
    not the distribution.
* [WWW::Statistics](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-www-statistics)
    * The [CPANTesters Statistics
      website](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-www-statistics),
      which shows lots of useful metrics like how many testers, which
      versions of Perl, which OSes, and etc...
* [WWW::Preferences](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-www-preferences)
    * The [CPANTesters Preferences
      website](https://prefs.cpantesters.org/) which allows authors and
      testers to configure how CPANTesters sends them reports and which
      reports get sent.

#### Clients

These modules provide APIs to fetch information from the CPANTesters web
app.

* [CPAN::Testers::WWW::Reports::Query::AJAX](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Testers::WWW::Reports::Query::AJAX)
    * Fetch CPANTesters results using AJAX, including aggregate results
      and individual report details.
* [CPAN::Testers::WWW::Reports::Query::Report](https://github.com/barbie/cpan-testers-www-reports-query-report)
    * Access individual reports from the CPANTesters Reports website.

#### Meta

These repositories are related to the CPANTesters application.

* [cpantesters-deploy](http://github.com/cpan-testers/cpantesters-deploy)
    * Automated deployment for the CPANTesters servers, along with
      a special deployment for development virtual machines.
    * This project handles the initial deployment of a machine,
      installing OS packages, setting up Perl, and setting up a user to
      run CPAN Testers processes. Individual projects can deploy
      themselves.

### Reporters

Reporters send test reports to the Metabase. These can be used to set up
your own CPANTesters smoke boxes.

* [CPAN::Reporter](https://github.com/cpan-testers/CPAN-Reporter)
    * This reporter works with the common CPAN client (CPAN.pm which is
      shipped with Perl)
